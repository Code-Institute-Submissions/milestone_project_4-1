## Design Decisions
The design decisions here is following the Django Code Institute tutorial quite closely to get as much as possible
working properly in the final product, but everything is simplified enough to make the user experience very
straight forward, allowing for quick navigation.

#### Color Scheme

Need to add color scheme

The current set of colors are all very bland but contrasting to make sure all the buttons and navigation is easy to
identify for the visitor, and to make sure no colors "drown" out as they navigate through everything.

#### Typography
I choose to use __Roboto__ for all text, which is the same as previous project, especially since this is a
e-commerce site, making the text easy to read, as well being one of the most common e-commerce fonts used.
